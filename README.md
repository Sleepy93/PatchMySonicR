Fix for SonicR on new Systems

This is a fix for an old game called SonicR 
>Wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_R

This game worked well on the old Systems (Win98, Xp) 
But had problems with running on Windows 7, 8.1 and 10

For Running it need DXWind but with Windows 10 it didn't worked well so I decided to make a tool for fix this issue.

# With my fix: 

You can specify the resolution of the game, and you can also specify the Drive where you have the game.

For me it's working well but. Use your own risk.
